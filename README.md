# Prowlarr for lemonfiber

**Holds your indexer accounts in one place and shares them with everything else.**
Prowlarr is one of the parts the stack lemonfiber ships is built from.
Without it: Every app needs indexers configured separately.

## How lemonfiber carries it

The default bundle in
[lemonfiber-plugins](https://github.com/lemonfiber/lemonfiber-plugins) pins this
repository by a revision and the digests of its manifest and its tree, and
lemonfiber compiles that tree in.
lemonfiber reaches Prowlarr through the adapter this repository holds, which
speaks lemonfiber's `indexer.search` contract in front of it: a Rust crate built
on the core's adapter kit and on
[adapter-kit-servarr](https://github.com/lemonfiber/adapter-kit-servarr), into the
image `ghcr.io/lemonfiber/prowlarr-adapter`, published from every commit on `main`
and from each tag the release train cuts. lemonfiber mints the key
Prowlarr answers its API to, hands it to Prowlarr as `PROWLARR__AUTH__APIKEY` and to the
adapter in its `upstream.json`, and to nothing else.

## What is here

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `plugin.toml` | The part's manifest |
| `recordings/prowlarr/` | The responses its proofs are held to |
| `src/` | The adapter |
| `conformance/indexer.search@1/` | The adapter's answer to each conformance case, in front of the pinned Prowlarr |
| `Dockerfile` | The adapter's image |
| `targets.toml` | The lemonfiber its checks run against, and the core the adapter is built on |
| `proofs.json` | What those checks said, committed |

## Checks

The plugin verdict is one job of spec's
[`first-party-plugin`](https://github.com/lemonfiber/spec/blob/main/.github/workflows/first-party-plugin.yml)
workflow: the manifest as the lemonfiber `targets.toml` names reads it, every
proof against its recording, and every pinned digest. The adapter is held to its
format, its lints, its tests, full line coverage and its dependency policy, its
image runs as lemonfiber runs it, and `recordings` takes every conformance case
again against the pinned Prowlarr. `just ci` runs the gates that need nothing but
this tree.
